                       ROUTERS   -    A router is a device that connects two or more
                                      packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves
                                      two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks 
                                      by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, 
                                      and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
                                      
                                      
                       FILTERS   -    Filter is a custom class where you can write custom logic
                                      to execute before or after an action method executes.
                                      
                                       Filters can be applied to an action method or controller in a declarative or programmatic way.
                                       Declarative means by applying a filter attribute to an action method or controller class and programmatic
                                       means by implementing a corresponding interface.
