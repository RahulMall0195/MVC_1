                       ROUTERS   -     A router is a device that connects two or more
                                       packet-switched networks or subnetworks. It serves
                                       two primary functions: managing traffic between these networks 
                                       by forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses, 
                                       and allowing multiple devices to use the same Internet connection.
                                      
                                      
                       FILTERS   -      Filter is a custom class where you can write custom logic
                                        to execute before or after an action method executes.
                                      
                                        Filters can be applied to an action method or controller in a declarative or programmatic way.
                                        Declarative means by applying a filter attribute to an action method or controller class and programmatic
                                        means by implementing a corresponding interface. 
                                      
                                            * Authorization filters 
                                            * Action filters 
                                            * Result filters 
                                            * Exception filters 
                                            
                     
                  ActionResult -        An action result is what a controller action returns in response to a browser request. The ASP.NET MVC 
                                        framework supports several types of action results including: ViewResult - Represents HTML and markup. EmptyResult -
                                        Represents no result. RedirectResult - Represents a redirection to a new URL.
                                            
                                            
                      
                       ViewBag  -      ViewBag is a way to pass data from the controller to the view. It is a type object and is a dynamic property
                                       under the controller base class. Compared to ViewData, it works similarly but
                                       is known to be a bit slower and was introduced in ASP.NET MVC 3.0
